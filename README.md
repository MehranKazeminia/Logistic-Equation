* The "Logistic Equation" seems extremely simple and completely deterministic.

* But for example, when R = 4, in successive iterations, all the results of this equation are different. That is, it actually generates random numbers.

* When R = 4, chaos occurs. Even with the slightest change in x0, the next results are new random numbers.
