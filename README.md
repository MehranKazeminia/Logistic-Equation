* The "Logistic Equation" seems extremely simple and completely deterministic.

* But for example, when R = 4, in successive iterations, all the results of this equation are different. That is, it actually generates random numbers.

* When R = 4, chaos occurs. Even with the slightest change in x0, the next results are new random numbers.

* "Logistic Equation" has many applications in the study of natural systems and especially to better understand complex natural systems. Note, of course, that "Logistics Equation" is not the only equation that is sometimes in  chaos, but it may be the most famous.


* In this notebook, we introduced another astonishment. That is, we proved that exactly at the points of the bifurcation, all the results in successive repetitions are different, and the period is so-called infinite. Of course, the difference in numbers is not large and may not be considered chaos. However, if in a calculation, very large coefficients are multiplied by the results, the final results can be very different in successive iterations. This means that these small differences can cause problems.
